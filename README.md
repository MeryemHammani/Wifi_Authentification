# Wifi_Authentification

## Objective
This application aims to enhance the security of school WiFi networks. The proposed solution involves assigning each user a random password to access the network, thereby limiting unauthorized access by external users. Additionally, we will implement a security mechanism that restricts external user access to a one-day period. To accomplish this, we will use the Python libraries Flask and Tkinter, along with an Oracle database, to ensure a secure and reliable system. Passwords are sent via Gmail.
