# Wifi_Authentification
# the objectif of this application 
the application aims  the enhancement of  the security of school WiFi networks.
The proposed solution involves assigning each user a random password to access the network, there by limiting the unauthorized access of external users. Furthermore, we will implement a security mechanism that limits external user access to a one-day period. To accomplish this, we will use the Python libraries Flask and Tkinter, as well as an Oracle database, to ensure a secure and reliable system.
we send password by gmail.
